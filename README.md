# number-guesser

Number Guesser game created. 
Another great lesson on using basic to intermediate JavaScript. 

DOM manipulation plus basic JS functions. 

This was fun to built. 

Purpose of the game is that a random number will be selected by the AI. 
The point of the game is to simply pick a number and hope it's equal or closest to the random target number.

You will be facing off against a BOT :)

Thank you,
