# number-guesser

Number Guesser game created. 
Another great lesson on using basic to intermediate JavaScript. 

This is a JavaScript code that defines a simple guessing game.

The game has a current round number and two scores, one for the human player and one for the computer player. There is a function to generate a random target number between 0 and 9, and a function to compare the guesses made by the human and the computer with the target number, returning true if the human's guess is closer to the target, and false if the computer's guess is closer.

There is also a function to update the scores based on the winner of each round, which is passed as an argument to the function. Finally, there is a function to advance the round number by 1.

The code includes some console logs to test the functions by generating a target number, updating the scores for the human and the computer players, and printing the current scores to the console.

This JavaScript code for a number guessing game that allows the player to guess a number between 1 and 9 and compare their guess with a computer guess. The game keeps track of the score for the player and the computer, and the player can advance to the next round after guessing. 

The code initializes variables for the human score, computer score, and current round number. It also includes functions for generating the target number, comparing guesses, updating the score, and advancing the round.

The code also defines several variables that correspond to different elements in the HTML file, such as the input for the human's guess, the displays for the scores and round number, and the buttons for guessing and advancing to the next round.

The code sets event listeners for the guess and next round buttons, as well as for the add and subtract buttons that allow the player to increase or decrease their guess. The handleValueChange function is called when the input for the human's guess changes, and it enables or disables the add and subtract buttons based on the value of the input.

You will be facing off against a BOT :)

Thank you,
